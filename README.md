Note: I'm not actively working with Qt anymore and stop building it years ago. This is totally unmaintained but for some reason people are giving it stars !? So it must be useful for someone somewhere ?

qt-patches
==========

All my build recipes and patches for the Qt versions I
used over the years.

Interresting versions:

* Qt 4.8.7: the last Qt 4 release
* Qt 5.3.2: the last release to support Mac OS X 10.6
* Qt 5.5.1: the last release to have QtWebKit
* Qt 5.6.0: the latest

## Windows

I use the following hierarchy to build the different versions
and their dependencies:
* c:\Qt
   * VS2010
   * VS2010x64
   * VS2012
   * VS2012x64
   * VS2013
   * VS2013x64
   * VS2015
   * VS2015x64

In each of them I have:
* icu
* openssl
* qt-{version}  (qt-5.3.2, qt-5.5.1, etc)

## Mac

I build Qt in /usr/local (/usr/local/Qt-4.8.7, /usr/local/Qt-5.3.2, etc).
